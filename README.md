# ReplyAI — Chrome Extension

> Context-aware AI reply suggestions, living right inside your conversations.

---

## What It Does

ReplyAI sits in your Chrome toolbar and reads the conversation you have open — WhatsApp Web, Instagram DMs, Hinge — then suggests 3 smart replies in whatever tone you want. One click to copy, then send.

No switching to ChatGPT. No copy-pasting. Just open the extension and hit Generate.

2. Toggle on **Developer mode** (top right corner)

**Description:**
```
The previous Quick Start section assumed everyone knew how to use
developer mode. Separated it into two clear paths:

- End users → Chrome Web Store (coming soon, star to get notified)
- Developers → Load unpacked instructions with a clear note that
  this is for dev/testing only

Fixes the confusion for non-technical users landing on the repo.

## Getting Your API Key

ReplyAI uses the Claude API (by Anthropic) to generate replies.

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Sign up / log in
3. Go to **API Keys** → Create a new key
4. Open ReplyAI → Settings → paste your key

Free daily limit: **10 replies/day** (resets at midnight).
With your own API key: **unlimited**.
